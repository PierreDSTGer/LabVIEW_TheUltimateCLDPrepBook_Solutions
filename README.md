# LabVIEW CLD – Final Solutions (ATM, Boiler, Car Wash, Sprinkler)

This repository contains the **final LabVIEW implementations** of the four official NI CLD-style exercises:

- **ATM**
- **Boiler Control**
- **Car Wash**
- **Sprinkler Controller**

These solutions were developed for my book:

📘 **“LabVIEW – The Ultimate CLD Preparation Book”**  
Available on Amazon.

The VIs follow **clean architecture**, **state-machine principles**, and **best practices** suitable for both CLD preparation and real-world LabVIEW development.
